To fix this, you should always ensure your Expo CLI and the SDK version in your project's `package.json` are compatible:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
   or
   ```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```
2. **Check your `package.json`:** Verify the `expo` package version. It should match or be compatible with the version of the Expo CLI.
3. **Update Expo SDK (If necessary):** If an update is needed, run:
   ```bash
expo upgrade
```
4. **Clean and reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
npm install
```
or
   ```bash
yarn install
```
5. **Create a fresh project (If problems persist):** Create a new project from scratch using `expo init my-new-project` and then copy your code into the new project. This can help rule out any lingering issues from a corrupted project setup.
