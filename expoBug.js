This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed locally and the project's Expo SDK version.  It can also happen due to corrupted or incomplete installations, or conflicts with other Node.js packages.

Example scenario:
Your project uses Expo SDK 45, but your global Expo CLI is outdated (e.g., version 4.12.0 which might not fully support SDK 45).
